Java Assignment -1
Ans-1-was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995.
 Java high level programming
There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows
Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
•	Web Applications such as irctc.co.in etc.
•	Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
•	Mobile
•	Embedded System
•	Smart Card
•	Robotics
•	Games, etc.

Easy to learn
Ans-2
•	java is a object oriented programming language
•	java high level programming language
•	class based programming language
•	java case sensitive programming language
•	java used oops concept then provide high security 
•	easy to learn
ans-3  
   Jdk = java development kit
                JDK is a software development environment for Java applications

 JRE = java environment
                 kit The JRE is what you need to run Java applications. It's a part of the JDK                       can also be distributed separately to run Java applications

JVM = java virtual machine  
                       Translates bytecode into machine language
Ans4- package assinment;

public class first {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		// ans 3
		System.out.println(" hello word");
		
		
	}
ANS-5  there are three types off variable
1.	locale variable (declared inside of a method, constructor, or code block.)
2.	Static variable (In a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block, the static keyword is used to declare class variables,Within a class, but outside of any methods, constructors, or blocks)
3.	Instance variable (Within a class, but outside of any methods, constructors, or blocks)
Ans-6 
•	  Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java.
•	Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
•	Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays, String.
Ans -9 
       Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations between two to operant 
•	Unary Operator (++ and –)
•	Arithmetic Operators (+, - , *, /, %)
•	String concatenation operator (+)
•	Relational Operators : (<, <=, >, >=)
•	Equality Operators (==, !=)
Ans-7
         Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
Ans -8     int a,b,c;
		Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);
		System.out.println(" enter a first no");
		
		a =input.nextInt();
		System.out.println(" enter a second no");
		b =input.nextInt();
		
		c=a+b;
		System.out.println(  " a + b ="+c);
Ans-10 System.out.println(" enter a key  1 for athermetic operetor 2 for assignment operetor 3 for Comparison opertor 4 for logical operetor"
				+ " 5 for  bitwise opertor");
		i=input.nextInt();
		if(i== 1) {
			System.out.println(" this is a arthemic opertor");
			System.out.println(  " a + b =");
			
		}
		else if (i==2) {
			int j=10;
			System.out.println(  " thise is a assignment opertor J=10"+j);
			
			
		}
		else if (i==3) {
			
			System.out.println(  " thise is a comprison opertor a>b"+ (a>b));
			
			
		}
		else if (i==4) {
			int j=10;
			System.out.println(  " thise is a logical  opertor "+ (j< a && j<b) );
			
			
		}
		else {
			System.out.println(" please enter a valid no");
		}
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
	}
